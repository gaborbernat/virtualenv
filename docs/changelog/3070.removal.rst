The Python discovery logic has been extracted into a standalone ``python-discovery`` package on PyPI (`documentation
<https://python-discovery.readthedocs.io/>`_) and is now consumed as a dependency. If you previously imported discovery
internals directly (e.g. ``from virtualenv.discovery.py_info import PythonInfo``), switch to ``from python_discovery
import PythonInfo``. Backward-compatibility re-export shims are provided at ``virtualenv.discovery.py_info``,
``virtualenv.discovery.py_spec``, and ``virtualenv.discovery.cached_py_info``, however these are considered unsupported
and may be removed in a future release - by :user:`gaborbernat`.
