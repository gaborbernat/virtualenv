The Python discovery logic has been extracted into a standalone ``python-discovery`` package on PyPI
(`documentation <https://python-discovery.readthedocs.io/>`_) and is now consumed as a dependency. If you
previously imported discovery internals directly (e.g. ``from virtualenv.py_discovery import PythonInfo``),
switch to ``from python_discovery import PythonInfo``. Backward-compatibility re-exports remain at
``virtualenv.discovery.py_info``, ``virtualenv.discovery.py_spec``, and ``virtualenv.discovery.cached_py_info``
- by :user:`gaborbernat`.
